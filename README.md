# RandomizerDefaultRewards
To combat early OP items drops (like Hide+5/Wand+5 etc.) in Monster Sanctuary's Randomizer, this mod replaces the monster drops with the drops of the original monster. E.g. in the first fight against the randomized Blob, you can only get Blob rewards (Green Gem, Vitality Ring, etc). Randomized monsters will still drop their respective eggs and catalysts of course, so you will get the egg of the monster you actually fight.

# Installation
This is a BepInEx plugin, so you need BepInEx and a ModLoader. I use the one suggested by Evaisa: https://modworkshop.net/mod/30598

Drop the contents into the Monster Sanctuary folder and start the game once. Exit again and then put the RandomizerDefaultRewards.dll into Monster Sanctuary/BepInEx/plugins.

On the first run after adding the plugin, it will create a config file in BepInEx/config/, so you can toggle the mod on and off without removing the .dll file.
